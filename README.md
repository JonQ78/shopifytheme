Install the Shopify CLI [Learn more on Shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli)

### Installing

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/shopify-thirdweb-theme
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

In one terminal run `npm run dev` to start the webpack dev server, which will watch for changes and compile your React code.

In another terminal run `shopify theme dev` to start the a local server which will let you preview your theme and make changes to your theme files.

To add your own React components you simply have to do the following:

1. Create a new React component in the `scripts` directory.
2. Make sure you tell react to render your code by having the following lines at the end of your file:

```jsx
const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".your-component");

// We loop through all the elements that have the class name "your-component" and render our React component inside of it, this allows you to add multiple instances of the same component to different pages.

elements &&
  [...elements].forEach((node) => {
    const root = createRoot(node);
    root.render(<YourComponent />);
  });
```

3. Update your entries in `webpack.common.js` to include your new component.

```js
entry: {
  ...,
  "your-component": "./scripts/your-component.js",
},
```

4. Create a new Liquid `Section` in the `sections` directory.

```liquid
<div class="your-component"></div>
{% schema %}
{
  "name": "Your new component",
  "presets": [
    {
      "category": "React Components",
      "name": "Your new component"
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}
```

5. Add a script tag to load your new component in the `layout/theme.liquid` file, make sure to add this at the end of the `<body>` tag.

```liquid
  <script src="{{ "your-component.bundle.js" | asset_url }}"></script>
```

### Publishing

To publish your theme to your store run `shopify theme push` in the root of your project.

## Theme Store submission
